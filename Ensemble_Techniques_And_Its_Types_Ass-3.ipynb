    "# Ensemble Learning: Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method, meaning it combines multiple individual models (decision trees in this case) to make a final prediction. This ensemble approach helps to reduce overfitting because the final prediction is based on the consensus of many trees rather than relying on a single complex model.\n",
    "# Bootstrap Sampling: During the construction of each decision tree in the forest, a random subset of the training data is sampled with replacement. This process, known as bootstrap sampling, ensures that each tree is trained on a slightly different subset of the data, introducing diversity among the trees. As a result, the ensemble is less likely to overfit to the training data because each tree has been trained on a different subset of samples.\n",
    "# Random Feature Selection: At each node of the decision tree, instead of considering all features for splitting, a random subset of features is considered. This feature randomness further diversifies the trees and prevents them from relying too heavily on any particular subset of features. It encourages each tree to focus on different aspects of the data, reducing overfitting.\n",
    "# Pruning: While individual decision trees in a Random Forest are allowed to grow to their maximum depth (or until a stopping criterion is met), the combination of multiple trees helps to smooth out the predictions. Trees that overfit the training data may still be present in the forest, but their impact on the final prediction is reduced through averaging."
